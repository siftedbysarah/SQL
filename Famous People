I created three tables: Movie Stars (table 1), Movies (table 2), and Charity Donations (table 3). All three included an ID to connect the rows from each table to each other.
I created a query conjoining the movie stars names and the movie titles from the first two tables, to show the name of the movie star next to the movie they starred in.
I next created a query to show only the movie stars who were Female, along with their age in ascending order.
Next, I created a query conjoining rows from the first and last table, to show the name of the movie star next to the charity they donated to, next to how much they donated. 
**Note - The data I compiled was not taken from any sources, I fictionalized it.
